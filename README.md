# Alexis-OS
This is an open source operating system. I made this Linux distro from LFS 8.2. 
This bootable ISO is made from RescueCD and is availible [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3S444sXPZW8TRDZ4buPqvchc0AbV_8S/view?usp=sharing)

## Future plans

 - Prepare Documentation
 - Make a website to host iso and documentation of this linux distro
